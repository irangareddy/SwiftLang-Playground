# SwiftLang Playground

Welcome to **SwiftLang Playground** — a personal learning repository documenting my journey from beginner to advanced proficiency in the Swift programming language.

## What's Inside

- Topic-by-topic breakdown based on Swift's official **Language Guide**
- Hands-on code examples with `.playground` files
- Notes for every concept in my own words
- [Summary of Topics](./Summary.md) for quick navigation
- Utility scripts and tasks to lint, check, and update progress

## Goals

- Build a deep understanding of Swift’s syntax and best practices
- Reinforce concepts with playground demos and real examples
- Create a helpful resource for others learning Swift
